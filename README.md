## To launch

For stupeflip lyrics generator:
```
python text_predictor.py stupeflip
```

For trolls generator:
```
python text_predictor.py comments
```


## In case of issues

In case of "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration":
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33183

Replace following line in linecache.py of your venv Python :
```
for mod in sys.modules.values():
```
with:
```
v = sys.modules.copy()
for mod in v:
```
